# VirtualDiefenbaker
A 3D Diefenbaker Simulation

This is a simple Godot game to simulate playing with a pet dog, namely the Wolf/Husky hybrid Diefenbaker of Due South fame.
This version of the game is built for Windows.
I tried to be certain to use freely available assets for everything I didn't make myself, if I mistakenly included anything
that requires attribution or licensing just let me know and I will correct the issue.
I hope to expand Diefenbaker at some point into a larger terrain exploration type game or perhaps give him some AI abilities.
